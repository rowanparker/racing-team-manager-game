- Production and development environments handled by [Docker](https://docker.com)
- Client data updates pushed using [Mercure](https://mercure.rocks)
- HTTPS served using [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com)
- All interactions through a REST API
- Test driven development of both backend and frontend 

### Game Overview

In this game players manage a car racing team.
They can purchase and upgrade vehicles,
as well as hire and train people (drivers and mechanics).

Players earn credits from racing, which can be used to unlock high tiers of the game.
